                    her from the True Knot, a cult whose goal is to feed off of

                    <br />More than two decades have passed since Sarah Connor
                    prevented Judgment Day, changed the future, and re-wrote the
                    fate of the human race. Dani Ramos is living a simple life
                    in Mexico City with her brother and father when a highly
                    advanced and deadly new Terminator – a Rev-9 – travels back
                    through time to hunt and kill her. Dani's survival depends
                    on her joining forces with two warriors: Grace, an enhanced

                <p>
                    <br />Simba idolises his father, King Mufasa, and takes to
                    heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom
                    celebrates the new cub's arrival. Scar, Mufasa's brother—and
                    former heir to the throne—has plans of his own. The battle
                    for Pride Rock is ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama,
                    ultimately resulting in Simba's exile. With help from a
                    curious pair of newfound friends, Simba will have to figure
                    out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully his.

                    <br />Ever since US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs
                    and lawless outcast Shaw first faced off, they just have
                    swapped smacks and bad words. But when cyber-genetically
                    enhanced anarchist Brixton's ruthless actions threaten the
                    future of humanity, both join forces to defeat him. (A
                    spin-off of “The Fate of the Furious,” focusing on Johnson's
                    Luke Hobbs and Statham's Deckard Shaw.)
